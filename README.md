# python_starkiller
As you may know, i like to rename my projects with star wars content. Here are all of the side scripts that i use just to test one function of a new module. Those are the early functionnality of my future projects that i like to test. That's why it's called 'starkiller', it's a reference to the original name of luke skywalker (it was the 'test' name) in the initial script of star wars.
